INTRO TO MACHINE LEARNING:

DECISION TREES: Break the data into different groups and determine hte response in each group

Fitting/Training the model - capturing patterns from the data
"Deeper" trees - trees that have more "splits" to capture additional factors
Leaf - The point at the bottom where we make a prediction

EDA:

- Get summary stats for all variables --> dataframe.describe()

- Checks for data quality (in house prices, theres no data after 2010)

- drop missing values --> df = df.dropna(axis=0)

- look at histograms (univariate analysis)

- look at box plots for summary statistics 



Building your Model:

Define - what type of model it will be (regression/decision tree/clustering) 

Fit - capture patterns provided in the data

Predict 

Evaluate - determine the model's accuracy
